## Demo

Repository contains demos for some observability platforms with useful resources. 

List of demos:
* [Jaeger](./jaeger/Readme.md) - open source, distributed tracing platform
* [ELK(ElasticSearch, Kibana)](./elk/Readme.md) - application performance monitoring system built on the Elastic Stack.
