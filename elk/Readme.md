# ElasticSearch and Kibana 

_Note:_ ES v8.* configuration became complicated, 
and you should follow [this](https://elasticsearch.evermight.com/docker-elk-2-agent-fleet-server-apm/)

**WARNING**: Section `Reconfigure output, add certificate` 
is required and must be done manually preferably on *nix OS.
